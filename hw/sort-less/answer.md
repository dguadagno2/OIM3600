# Results Analysis
# For the selection sort I expected it to be the second longest program as I expected the longest method to be the bubble sorting method. As the first method selects the smallest unit by running through a small subsection and then orders it in the front. While the second method compares two units and then swaps them by going through every unit. As such one would expect that the first method would be faster as it is working with a smaller section and it is not compared. Finally I expected the last option to be the fastest as like we discussed in class the fastest way to sort is to divide the population by half until the number you are looking for is in te subset.
