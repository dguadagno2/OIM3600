1. Supposing that spotify bases their 'aura' off of the average energy, valence and danceability of a persons songs I would characterize this database as Purple. I chose this characteristic as the danceability of the songs came out to an average of .71646 which is high when compared to the norm (if we expect the norm to be .50). Addtionally, the average energy was 0.65906 which was high when compared to the norm as well. Finally there is the valence is which comes in as average with a score of .484443. I chose purple due to the fact that danceability was highest while the second highest was energy. The seocnd closest characteristic was orange but I beleived that energy shold be higher than danceability for an orange characteristics. 
This aura reading may not be very representative of the listener because it doesn't take into account the tone or mood of the song. Just because a song is high energy or dancable it doesn't make the song upbeat or rebellious. There may be a correlation with these songs and higher levels of energy or danceability. However, in order to be more accurae their would either need to be more data collected in terms of differnet categories or such a vast collection of data that the model is highly accurate in differentiating ongs based on only the two categories.
